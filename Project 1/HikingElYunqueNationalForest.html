    <q>Plan a soul-refreshing escape to an enchanted rainforest park.
    This natural treasure is an excellent destination if you want to be immersed in nature. You can visit for a hike on one of its many trails, bathe in natural pools beneath waterfalls, or relax and enjoy the scenery.
    El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest Service, and its name is a reference to Yuke, what the indigenous Taíno people defined as "white lands."
    With an average rainfall of 120 inches a year, El Yunque has a very diverse ecosystem, hosting hundreds of unique plant and animal species, including the Island's famous coquí frog.</q>
