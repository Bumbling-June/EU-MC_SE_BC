      <div class="box"><p>Festivals in Puerto Rico are colorful and loud: live bands play, amusement park rides twirl, parades take over streets, and, of course, fried foods are enjoyed. Each festival is rooted in tradition, often Catholic in origin, starting mostly mid-week and lasting through the weekend.</p></div>

    <q cite="">Puerto Rico's largest and most concurred festival!
      Fiestas de la Calle San Sebastián, is the unofficial closing to the longest holiday season in the world. During the multi-day celebrations, Old San Juan is completely taken over by live music, impromptu dancing in every street corner, and even circus performances!
      At daytime, the old city’s plazas and streets are filled with local artists and artisans, showcasing and selling everything from paintings to hand-made jewelry. Once the sun goes down, multiple concerts and parties take place across the walled city, and the joyous revelry continues into the late hours of the night</q>
